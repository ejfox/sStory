**Vulpes Interactive Infographic Template**

The vision for this project was to create a template/boilerplate for creating interactive graphics using D3 and the LESS framework that would make it easy to move from concept to code without the hassle of setting up an environment with everything necessary. I've tried, wherever possible, to only include the things that I use 9/10 times creating interactive infographics, so I imagine this project will always be in some sort of flux as I add new stuff and take away what is not needed.

Currently all that is included is a template with the proper libraries included, but I am working to build a better example/wireframe page to build off of. 

I am also considering working on a sister/branch of this project  for interactive templates based on Jmpress.js ( http://shama.github.com/jmpress.js/ ) 

The libraries/frameworks currently included are:

* LESS Framework 4 - http://lessframework.com/

* jQuery - http://jquery.com/

* Underscore - http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/

* D3.js - https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/API-Reference
